Armalive server setup

- Make sure you have a running, working server setup, and that the missions otherwise run properly. Setting up armalive is the last thing you do.

- Drop the @armalive folder in the server, and add it as a mod folder, as per usual.
Clients do not need, nor want, the @armalive extension running.

- If you do not have a valid armalive_conninfo, you need to ask for one. If it contains a very generic username/password, you need a proper one. 
If you need one, try asking staff@armalive.com or ask mahuja.net on skype.
Note that two servers running using the same username will block each others reporting. 
We do not support automatic signups for this; player displays are by default global and someone could sign up a server just to inject false scores.

- The armalive_conninfo file requires special attention.
This file contains a password that must not be readable by other means like loadfile. The password could be used to impersonate your server and inject false data.
The extension will search for it in the arma3 folder, arma3/@armalive folder, and parent folder of arma3, in that order. 
The parent folder was added so it can be used if the server is not properly configured with loadfileextensions etc.

- ATLAS should already support armalive. 
A more general script suite that can simply be dropped in as an addon, and work for every mission has not been made yet,
 but a specification of what it has to support exists at https://github.com/MaHuJa/Armalive/tree/master/doc
Much of the time you have to combine the output of several eventhandlers to figure out what to report.
 
- Welcome to the second generation of arma statskeeping system, armalive v2.
Unfortunately we don't do much in the way of pretty displays, maps with overlays, and much more that's on the wishlist - yet.
 
- After the server stops, the process may keep running in the background until FreeLibrary() is called, which the arma3server does not currently do, or the process is forcibly terminated. 
This may trick watchdog programs that would otherwise restart it.

- A linux extension has not yet been made, mainly because I haven't set up the compile/test server for doing that.
