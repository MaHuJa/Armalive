Armalive

Armalive.com is a website that will show statistics over what happened in a game of Arma, by Bohemia Interactive.

The history of armalive starts with bstats in the first half of 2011. 
Bstats is a script suite designed to replace BI's rather lacking detection of various scoring events.
Written by Spyder, with MaHuJa's research help.
From that I (MaHuJa) came up with the idea of exporting this data to a database and website.

We had linux server support from the beginning - before extensions were available for windows, let alone linux.

The extension currently requires the
Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
and in particular it needs the 32-bit version. vcredist_x86.exe 

Linux extension to follow.

For the time being I give only specific permission to use these works.
Feel free to ask for permission; tell me what your ideas are.
